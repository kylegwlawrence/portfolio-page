## Python Projects
### Mario Kart Scoreboard OCR
#### Problem: 
- Mario Kart for Nintendo Switch doesn't have a way for you to track your races across multiple grand prix or VS race sessions.

#### Solution:
- use optical character recognition to extract place, player name, and score from the post-race scoreboard.
#### Future dev:
- send the image to a Slack channel and receive a summary back
- produce lifetime statistics for each player

### Travel Planner
#### Problem:
- planning a trip requires visiting multiple websites and manually gathering data to determine the best options for your trip as a whole. This can involve researching driving directions, parking, flights, car rentals, accommodations, attractions and more. There is no tool that can provide recommendations for all parts of a trip with various parameters and filters.
#### Solution:
- create an application that will accept parameter and filter inputs to define and design a trip from end to end.
#### Future dev: 
- create a Slack bot that will take in trip information and return a summary of the trip plan
- add APIS for flights, public transportation, car rentals, ferry service, toll roads, pit stops

### Stocks Analysis
#### Problem: 
- rather than using existing stock tracking apps, I wanted to build something simple for my own use. I've always been interested in the math behind finance so I wanted to learn more about technicals, in addition to more Python experience
#### Solution:
- pull daily stock data from a free API and track technicals for each stock in my portfolio
#### Future dev:
- send alerts when a stock has significant changes in technicals
- recommend other well-performing stocks that would match my portfolio

### Receipt OCR
#### Problem: 
- I wanted to understand how I'm spending my money at a product and product category level, not just at a store level. 
#### Solution:
- use optical character recognition to extract receipt data and summarize the items and total cost
#### Future dev: 
- send the image to a Slack channel and receive a summary back
- create a dashboard to track my trends and help me figure out what I'm spending too much money on
- send alerts when a particu;ar spending habit is getting out of control
