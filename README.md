## Python Projects
Below is a list of four personal Python projects that I've created to solve my own unique problems. 

### Mario Kart Scoreboard OCR - built with Claude Code
#### Problem: 
Mario Kart for Nintendo Switch doesn't have a way for you to track your races across multiple grand prix or VS race sessions.

#### Solution:
Use optical character recognition to extract place, player name, and score from the post-race scoreboard.
#### Future dev:
- Send the image to a Slack channel and receive a summary back
- Produce lifetime statistics for each player

### Travel Planner
#### Problem:
Planning a trip requires visiting multiple websites and manually gathering data to determine the best options for your trip as a whole. This can involve researching driving directions, parking, flights, car rentals, accommodations, attractions and more. There is no tool that can provide recommendations for all parts of a trip with various parameters and filters.
#### Solution:
Create an application that will accept parameter and filter inputs to define and design a trip from end to end.
#### Future dev: 
- Create a Slack bot that will take in trip information and return a summary of the trip plan
- Add APIS for flights, public transportation, car rentals, ferry service, toll roads, pit stops
- Identify additional travel functions/priorities/preferences to include

### Stocks Analysis
#### Problem: 
Rather than using existing stock tracking apps, I wanted to build something simple for my own use. I've always been interested in the math behind finance so I wanted to learn more about technicals, in addition to gaining more Python experience
#### Solution:
Pull daily stock data from a free API and track selected technicals for each stock in my portfolio
#### Future dev:
- Send alerts when a stock has a significant changes in technicals
- Recommend other well-performing stocks that would match my portfolio
- Send me buy/sell signals

### Receipt OCR
#### Problem: 
I wanted to understand how I'm spending my money at a product and product category level, not just at a store level, so I can have better control of my health, habits, and finances
#### Solution:
Use optical character recognition to extract receipt data, store in a database, and create analytical reports and auto recommendations
#### Future dev: 
- Send the image to a Slack channel and receive a summary back
- Create an algorithm and dashboard to track my trends and recommend spending changes
- Ingest other expenses, income, and investments to get a full, detailed understanding of my situation both short and long term
